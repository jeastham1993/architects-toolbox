# Architects Toolbox

The Architects Toolbox is a set of sample applications and code samples written in .NET core intended to be used as starting points for new software projects. A toolbox for the software architect.

To often, the same common patterns repeat themselves across many different projects, applications and libraries. I intend for this repo to give a standard set of 'template' projects that can be easily forked and copied for use by the wider world.

All code files can be found under the src directory. Documentation can be found for each sample within the relevant src folder.

There is also a master Solution File (all.sln) in the repo root that contains every application available.
